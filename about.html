   <h3>My name is Kyla Brown and I am 14 years old. I graduated from Pershing West Middle School, in June 2013 and will be attending George Westinghouse College Prep this fall. My favorite color is blue like the beautiful sky. I enjoy helping people and being that sister that someone never had. My hobbies are dancing, reading, listening to music, and hanging out with friends. I love to dance because it expresses me. I enjoy reading and I am currently reading Shakespare, Comedy of Errors. Music is my life, it keeps me calm in every situation. Lastly, I enjoy hanging out with my friends because it's fun and they help me out alot. This summer, I am working with the Englewood Codes project. Englewood Codes is a summer program where teens in Englewood learn to code and prepare to be tech leaders.</h3>

   <h3>I enjoy today's music but I perfer to listen 90's R&B music. Some of my favorite artist would be R.Kelly, Rihanna, Ciara, Robin Thicke, and much more. </h3>
