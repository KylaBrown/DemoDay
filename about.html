   <p>My name is Kyla Brown and I am 14 years old. I am apart of the class of 2013 and will be attending George Westinghouse College Prep in the fall as an incoming Freshman. This summer I am learning how to code. My favorite color is blue like the beautiful sky. I enjoy helping people and being that sister that someone never had. I Enjoy reading new things; currently I am reading Shakespare, Comedy of Errors and I Love it. I recommend it to teens 14 and up.</p>

   <p>I enjoy today's music but I perfer to listen 90's R&B music. Some of my favorite artist would be R.Kelly, Rihanna, Ciara, Robin Thicke, and much more. My favorite candy is Skittles, so many of my friends call me Skittles instead of Kyla.
